# RawSugar

RawSugar is our system for raw data storage and organization. Using RawSugar you can match your raw files to associated sample metadata for downstream processing and loading into CANDEL.

Go to [rawsugar.parkerici.org](https://rawsugar.parkerici.org) to access the web interface.

Go to [RawSugar releases](https://github.com/ParkerICI/rawsugar/releases) to download the latest version of the CLI.

Check out the [RawSugar user guide](https://github.com/ParkerICI/rawsugar/blob/master/doc/user-guide.org) and [RawSugar CLI documentation](https://github.com/ParkerICI/rawsugar/blob/master/README.md) for more information on usage.
